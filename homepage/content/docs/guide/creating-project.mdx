# World Orchestration

Vibecape's core differentiator is "World Orchestration". Unlike standard writing tools that see text, Vibecape sees **entities** and **relationships**.

## 🌍 The World Bible

The World Bible is a structured database living alongside your prose.

### Entities

Everything in your story is an entity:

- **Characters**: Protagonists, NPCs, villains.
- **Locations**: Cities, rooms, planets.
- **Items**: Magical artifacts, weapons, key evidence.
- **Events**: Historical wars, backstory moments.

### Relationships

Define how entities interact.

- _Alice_ is the **daughter** of _Bob_.
- _The Sword of Omens_ is **located in** _The Cave of Wonders_.
- _The Great War_ **precipitated** _The Fall of the Kingdom_.

## 🔗 Context Injection

When you write, Vibecape analyzes your cursor position.

1. **Mention Detection**: If you type "Alice", the AI pulls Alice's character sheet into context.
2. **Consistency Check**: If you write "Alice drew her gun", but Alice's inventory only has a knife, the AI (in Critic mode) might flag a continuity error.
3. **Lore Suggestions**: Ask "What happened here 50 years ago?", and the AI checks the Location history and Event timeline to answer.

## 🧩 Modules

You can extend your world with specialized modules:

- **Timeline Manager**: Visualize chronological events.
- **Relationship Map**: A node-graph of character dynamics.
- **Export Manager**: Compile your world into a PDF bible or EPUB novel.

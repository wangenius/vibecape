## 🎯 Creating Your First World

Vibecape organizes work into "Worlds". A world contains all your stories, characters, locations, and lore.

### 1. New World

- Click **"New World"** on the welcome screen.
- Choose a template:
  - **Novel**: Optimized for long-form prose with chapter management.
  - **Screenplay**: Standard formatting for scripts.
  - **World Bible**: Logic-first workspace for pure lore building.

### 2. Configure AI Persona

Every world has a dedicated AI assistant.

- **Name**: Give your co-pilot a name (e.g., "Jarvis", "Muse").
- **Role**: Select a preset (Editor, Brainstormer, Critic).
- **Creativity**: Adjust the "Temperature" slider to control how imaginative (or hallucinations) the AI should likely be.

## 📁 Workspace Overview

- **Left Sidebar**: Character sheets, Locations, timeline events.
- **Center Canvas**: Your main writing area (infinite canvas or document view).
- **Right Sidebar**: AI Chat and Context Inspector.

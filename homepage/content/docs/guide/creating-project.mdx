# Creating a Project

This guide covers the various ways to initialize and extend your projects using Vibe CLI.

## 🎯 Interactive Mode

The easiest way to start is the interactive wizard. It will guide you through template selection, package manager preference, and optional features.

```bash
vibe create my-app
```

## 🛠 Command Reference

### `vibe run`

Execute scripts defined in your project.

```bash
vibe run [script-name]
```

**How it works:**

1. Checks for a matching script in `./scripts/[script-name].sh` or `./scripts/[script-name].ts`.
2. Fallback: Checks your `package.json` scripts.

### `vibe add`

Inject capabilities into your project. Features are modular and "drop-in".

```bash
vibe add [category]
```

**Common Categories:**

#### 📦 Packages

Add optimized dependencies that are pre-configured for modern stacks.

```bash
vibe add package
# Choices:
# [ ] axios
# [ ] ai-sdk
```

#### 🗄️ Database

Spin up database connections and schemas.

```bash
vibe add database
# Choices:
# [ ] drizzle:libsql
# [ ] supabase
```

#### 🚀 Workflow

CI/CD and automation scripts.

```bash
vibe add workflow
# Choices:
# [ ] package_publish_on_github
# [ ] vercel
```

#### 🧩 Services

Full-stack feature modules with UI, backend, and database logic.

```bash
vibe add services
# Choices:
# [ ] user_manager
# [ ] mail
# [ ] payment
```

#### 🎨 UI

Design systems and component libraries.

```bash
vibe add ui
# Choices:
# [ ] tailwind:v4
# [ ] shadcn
# [ ] icon:tabler
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The CLI behavior is controlled by `vibe.config.json` at your project root.

```json title="vibe.config.json"
{
  "scripts": "./scripts",
  "template": "ai-native"
}
```

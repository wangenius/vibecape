# Vibecape

The CLI for AI‑native Coders（we called them Product Creators）. Spin up apps, add modules, and ship with one command.

## 📋 Introduction

Vibecape is an integrated CLI for ProCreators. It helps you:
- Create projects from opinionated templates
- Add ready‑to‑use modules (auth, payments, homepage, and more)
- Run project scripts consistently (deploy, build, test)
- Collaborate with AI agents in your terminal

Build a full‑stack, production‑ready service with a single command.

## Why Vibecape

“Vibe” is your creative flow; Vibecape is the cape that amplifies it. Stop yak‑shaving and start shipping.

1. Create from curated templates (Next.js, npm package, desktop client, and more):

```bash
vibe create my-app
[x] blank template
[ ] nextjs-template: description
[ ] npm-template: description
```

2. Add modules on demand (auth, payments, homepage):

```bash
# vibe add can intergret some modules
vibe add module
[x] user auth
[] payment
[] homepage
```

3. Run scripts consistently (ships with useful defaults):

```bash
vibe run deploy
```

> Under the hood, `vibe run` executes `.sh` scripts from `./scripts`.

4. Work with AI agents in‑terminal:
```bash
vibe ai
> [user]: 
> [vibe]:
> [user]:
```

## Quick Start

```bash
npm i vibecape
```

```bash
vibe init
```

## Features

# Introduction

**vibecape** is the definitive CLI toolchain for the AI-native developer. It bridges the gap between terminal-based workflows and modern AI coding agents.

## Who is this for?

- **AI-Native Coders**: Developers who use LLMs (Claude, GPT-4) as their primary coding engine.
- **Product Creators**: Makers building SaaS, apps, or tools who need production-ready infrastructure instantly.

## Key Features

- **Template scaffolding**: Launch production-ready stacks with comprehensive documentation optimized for AI consumption.
- **Agent Integration**: A CLI that speaks "Agent". Pipe context directly to your AI tools.
- **Modular Architecture**: Add/remove capabilities (Auth, Database, Payments) via `vibe add`.
- **Node.js Integrated**: Built on the ecosystem you already know.

## Getting Started

Get up and running in less than 60 seconds.

```bash
# Global installation
npm install -g vibecape

# Initialize a new project
vibe init my-app

# Start the development server
vibe run dev
```

## AI Interactions

Vibecape is designed to be conversational.

```bash
# Ask questions about your project context
vibe chat "How do I add a new API route?"
```

```bash
# Generate a new feature implementation plan
vibe hero "Plan a user authentication flow"
```

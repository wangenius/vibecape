# Introduction

**Vibecape** (formerly Jezzlab) is a local-first creative writing studio designed for novelists, screenwriters, and world-builders who want to collaborate with AI without sacrificing privacy or control.

## Why Vibecape?

Traditional text editors treat stories as linear strings of text. **Vibecape treats stories as worlds.**

- **Context-Aware AI**: The AI knows your characters, locations, and lore. It doesn't just autocomplete text; it suggests plot points that fit your established world logic.
- **Visual Orchestration**: Manage timelines, character relationships, and story beats on an infinite canvas.
- **Local & Private**: Your magnum opus stays on your machine. We don't train on your data.

## Key Features

- **World Bible**: A structured database for your lore that the AI actively references.
- **Dynamic Personas**: Configure AI writing partners for different needs (e.g., "Ruthless Editor", "Imaginative Co-author", "Loremaster").
- **Focus Mode**: A distraction-free writing environment with typewriter scrolling and ambient sounds.
